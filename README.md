# a-minimal-ts

A demo package with minimal Typescript functionality.
This package can be used as a skeleton or template for quickly building new TypeScript packages, without wasting time on setup of boilerplate configurations and supporting tools.

Provides the following functionality:

1. Module style (import/export)
2. API
   - `multiply` - multiplies two numbers
   - `wrapInArray` - generic function
3. Typescript
4. eslint coding style validation
   - jsdoc and tsdoc rules enforcement
5. prettier formatting
6. jest unit tests
7. `husky` git [hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) - ensure that git commits are of high quality
8. `commitlint` - ensure that commit subjects comply with [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specifications
9. `pnpm` package manager
10. NodeJS Continuos Integration Github workflow

# Prerequisites

## PNPM installation

Install the `pnpm` package manager

```
npm install pnpm -g
```

# Getting started

Run the command:

```shell
pnpm install
```

# Tests

## Running `jest` unit tests

Run the command:

```shell
pnpm test
```

# Release

## How to publish a new version to NPM

Increment the version by running the command: (select one of the three options)

```shell
npm version patch
```

or

```shell
npm version minor
```

or

```shell
npm version major
```

If the version was incremented successfully then the code with new tags would be pushed automatically to the version control system code repository (e.g. github)

A similar expected output on terminal would be:

```console
Enumerating objects: 32, done.
Counting objects: 100% (32/32), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.

To https://github.com/bigman73/minimal-ts
 * [new tag]         v1.0.3 -> v1.0.3
v1.0.3
```

Then publish the new version of the package to `npm` with:

```shell
npm publish
```

A similar expected output on terminal would be:

```console
npm notice
npm notice ðŸ“¦  a-minimal-ts@1.0.3
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
npm notice 1.1kB LICENSE
npm notice 284B  README.md
npm notice 194B  lib/index.d.ts
```
